```

### **Example Scenarios**
- **Even Match (1:1)**: Both wrestlers = 500 points
- **Slight Favorite (1.5:1)**: Favorite = 667, Underdog = 1000
- **Moderate Favorite (3:1)**: Favorite = 333, Underdog = 1000
- **Heavy Favorite (9:1)**: Favorite = 111, Underdog = 1000
- **Extreme Favorite (20:1)**: Favorite = 50, Underdog = 1000

### **Strategic Implications**
- Encourages picking underdogs for high-risk/high-reward
- Rewards consistent accuracy with favorites
